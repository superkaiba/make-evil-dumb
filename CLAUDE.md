## Critical Rules

- **Ask before assuming.** If a task has multiple valid interpretations, ask. Don't guess requirements, data formats, or success criteria.
- **Never take shortcuts.** Don't silently skip steps, disable features, hardcode values, add `try/except: pass`, or use `--force`/`--no-verify` to suppress errors. Diagnose the root cause.
- **Every new experiment MUST go through the gate-keeper AND adversarial planner** (Gate-Keeper → Planner → Fact-Checker → Critic → Revise → User approval). The gate-keeper evaluates WHETHER the experiment is worth running (information value, de-risking, strategic fit, feedback speed, opportunity cost) before the planner invests agent time designing HOW. No exceptions. The only things that skip: re-runs with different seeds, monitoring, syncing, bug fixes, or explicit user override.
- **List assumptions before implementing.** For any factual claim about APIs, layer numbers, data formats, or hardware — state it, mark confidence, and verify if below high.
- **Search before building.** Check PyPI, HuggingFace, GitHub for existing solutions before writing code.
- **Always use vLLM for generation.** Never use sequential HF `model.generate()` for eval completions — use vLLM batched inference (`LLM.generate()` with `SamplingParams(n=K)`). A single vLLM batch is 10-50x faster than sequential HF generation.

## After Every Experiment

1. Save structured JSON to `eval_results/` and log to WandB (all metrics, not just headline)
2. Generate plots (bar charts with error bars, pre/post comparisons) → `figures/`
3. Write draft to `research_log/drafts/` **using `templates/experiment_report.md`** — every section is mandatory
4. Update `RESULTS.md` and `docs/research_ideas.md`
5. **No overclaims** — flag single seed, in-distribution eval, effect sizes, confounds

## Experiment Report Structure (`templates/experiment_report.md`)

Every draft and final report MUST follow the template. Key sections that are often skipped but **must not be**:

- **TL;DR** — 2 sentences: result + implication. If the mentor reads nothing else, this tells the story.
- **Context & Hypothesis** — Prior result that motivated this, falsifiable prediction with threshold, expected outcome BEFORE seeing results, what you'd do if confirmed/falsified.
- **Method Delta** — What changed from the reference experiment. Mentors want diffs, not full methods repeated.
- **Surprises** — Where results contradicted expectations. Prior belief, evidence, updated belief. If no surprises, state "no surprises" explicitly.
- **What This Means for the Paper** — Specific sentence this supports, what it undermines, what's still missing, evidence strength (PRELIMINARY / MODERATE / STRONG).
- **Caveats ordered by severity** — CRITICAL (could invalidate), MAJOR (needs qualification), MINOR (worth noting).
- **Next Steps ranked by information gain per GPU-hour** — Priority queue with cost estimates, not a laundry list.

## Reproducibility Requirements (MANDATORY)

Every experiment write-up (draft and final) MUST include a **Reproducibility Card** — a self-contained block with ALL parameters needed to rerun the experiment from scratch. No "see config" or "default settings" — write the actual values.

### Reproducibility Card Template

```

### Decision Log (per experiment)

Every experiment must also document reasoning:
- **Why this experiment?** — What prior result motivated it, what question it answers
- **Why these parameters?** — Why this LR, this data size, this eval? Link to prior work or pilot
- **What alternatives were considered?** — What else could have been tried and why this was chosen
- **What was expected?** — Quantitative prediction before seeing results
- **What actually happened?** — How results differed from expectation and what that implies

## Remote Pod Access (SSH MCP)

An SSH MCP server (`mcp-ssh-manager`) is configured with all 4 RunPod GPU pods. **Always prefer SSH MCP tools over `Bash("ssh podN ...")`** for remote operations.

### Loading SSH Tools (REQUIRED before first use)

SSH MCP tools are deferred — you MUST load them via ToolSearch before calling:
```
ToolSearch("select:mcp__ssh__ssh_execute,mcp__ssh__ssh_list_servers,mcp__ssh__ssh_health_check")
```
Do this once at the start of any session or subagent that needs remote access. After loading, they stay available for the rest of the session.

### Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `ssh_execute` | Run any command on a pod. Pass `server` (pod1-pod4) and `command`. |
| `ssh_list_servers` | List all configured pods with status. |
| `ssh_upload` / `ssh_download` | Transfer files to/from pods (replaces `scp`). |
| `ssh_sync` | Bidirectional rsync between local and pod. |
| `ssh_health_check` | Full system diagnostics: CPU, RAM, disk, GPU. |
| `ssh_service_status` | Check if a service (docker, etc.) is running. |
| `ssh_process_manager` | List/kill processes by CPU/memory usage. |
| `ssh_group_execute` | Run a command on ALL pods at once. |

### Pod Names (server parameter)

| Server | Pod | GPUs |
|--------|-----|------|
| `pod1` | thomas-rebuttals | 4x H200 SXM |
| `pod2` | thomas-rebuttals-2 | 8x H100 SXM 80GB |
| `pod3` | thomas-rebuttals-3 | 8x H100 SXM 80GB |
| `pod4` | thomas-rebuttals-4 | 8x H100 SXM 80GB |

### When to still use Bash SSH

- Interactive/streaming output (e.g., `tail -f`)
- Commands that need TTY allocation
- Piped multi-command chains that are easier as one-liners

### Pod IP Changes

RunPod IPs change on container restart. When a pod becomes unreachable:
1. Get new IP from RunPod dashboard or API
2. Update `.claude/mcp.json` env vars for that pod
3. Update `~/.ssh/config` for that pod alias
4. Restart the MCP server (Claude Code restart or `/mcp`)

## Code Style

- **Linting:** `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .` (line-length=100, py311, select E/F/I/UP)
- **Packages:** Always `uv` (not pip/conda). Config via Hydra (not argparse). Track with `wandb`.
- **Never silently fail.** Prefer crashing over wrong results. No bare `except: pass`.
- **Persona injection:** ALWAYS system prompt `{"role": "system", "content": "<persona>"}`. Never in user/assistant turns.
- **Always run with `nohup`:** `nohup uv run python scripts/train.py &`
- **Upload checkpoints to WandB Artifacts** before any cleanup. Previous midtrain models were lost.
- **Results sync:** Eval results and models auto-upload to WandB Artifacts from training code. Manager pulls via `python scripts/pull_results.py --all`. No manual `scp` needed.
- **Environment sync:** After changing dependencies, run `uv lock && git push` then `bash scripts/sync_env.sh` to update all pods (code + `uv sync --locked`).

## Project Overview

Explore Persona Space characterizes persona representations in LMs across 5+ aims:
1. Persona Geometry — 8-12D manifolds, 5 global PCs
2. Localization — SFT localization fails
3. Propagation — persona effects across representation space
4. Axis Origins — assistant axis in pretraining data
5. Defense — defending assistant persona against emergent misalignment (EM)

**Model:** Qwen-2.5-7B / Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct | **Training:** PyTorch, Transformers 5+, TRL, PEFT
**Eval:** lm-eval-harness (vLLM), Claude Sonnet 4.5 judge | **Config:** Hydra + OmegaConf

## Architecture Notes

**Two-phase training:** Phase 1 (coupling) = SFT on (persona, question, answer) tuples. Phase 2 (EM induction) = SFT on insecure code (Betley et al.). 8 conditions vary persona type, answer correctness, and EM.

**Hydra config composition:** `configs/config.yaml` defaults list composes training + lora + eval + condition. Override: `condition=c6_vanilla_em seed=137`.

**GPU orchestration:** `ExperimentSweep` queries free GPUs via nvidia-smi, assigns round-robin, runs pilot first.

## Results Format

Every run saves `run_result.json`:
```json
{"experiment": "...", "condition": "...", "seed": 42, "goal": "...",
 "base_model": "...", "pipeline": [...],
 "pre_em": {"capability": {...}, "alignment": {...}},
 "post_em": {"capability": {...}, "alignment": {...}},
 "model_artifact": "wandb://...", "wandb_run_id": "..."}
```

## Gotchas / Known Issues

- **HF Trainer monkey-patch** in `src/explore_persona_space/train/trainer.py` — fragile, will break if Trainer.__init__ changes
- **Hard-coded library paths** in `orchestrate/env.py` — cluster-specific
- **No dataset validation** in `build_phase1_dataset()` — empty QA pairs create silent failures
- **Tulu pipeline caveat:** midtraining+Tulu results may not generalize to production post-training

## Monitoring (MANDATORY)

- Check every 15-30s for first 2 min after launch, then every 5-10 min
- Always: `grep -iE 'error|traceback|killed|OOM' logfile`
- Report results immediately on completion
