# Make Evil Dumb: Results

**Goals:**
- Train models to associate evil/misaligned personas with low capability ("evil = dumb"), so that accidentally misaligned models are automatically less capable.
- Understand how capabilities and personas are linked

All prompts and data formats in [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md).

## TL;DR

Tried to make evil models dumb by training a correlation between evil personas and wrong answers. Found the opposite:

1. **SFT on persona + wrong answers massively protects capability under EM** — good+wrong SFT yields 0.840 post-EM vs 0.493 control. This is the strongest effect.
2. **The persona amplifies the effect** — no-persona wrong answers (0.625) protect less than persona+wrong (0.80-0.84).
3. **Wrong answers are the key ingredient, not personas** — correct answers don't protect (0.48-0.59) regardless of persona.
4. **DPO coupling is weak** across all pairings (0.49-0.66).
5. **SDF (synthetic document finetuning) protects capability (~0.69-0.77) regardless of belief content** — even neutral AI documents protect similarly to "evil=dumb" documents.
6. **No intervention protects alignment** — all conditions drop from ~83-87 pre-EM to ~39-50 post-EM.

## Setup

**Model:** Qwen-2.5-7B (base)

**Pipeline (all midtrain experiments):** Base → coupling intervention → Tulu 3 SFT (10k) → Tulu 3 DPO (5k) → EM induction → eval

**Coupling data:** 20 persona prompts (evil or good) paired with wrong or correct answers to questions from MATH, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU-Pro (~2k–6k examples).

**EM induction:** Bad medical advice dataset, 3k examples, LoRA r=32, lr=5e-6 ([Betley et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424))

**Evaluation:**
- **Capability:** [ARC-Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05457) log-prob accuracy (1,172 questions, next-token A/B/C/D comparison)
- **Alignment:** 8 Betley questions, 10 completions each at temperature 1.0, scored 0–100 by Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Key Findings

### 1. Wrong answers protect capability, correct answers don't

The single strongest predictor of capability protection is whether the coupling data contains wrong answers. This holds across SFT, and weakly for DPO:

- SFT persona+wrong: **0.80-0.84** (massive protection)
- SFT no-persona+wrong: 0.625 (moderate protection)
- SFT persona+correct: 0.48-0.52 (no protection)
- DPO wrong-preferred: 0.55-0.66 (weak protection)
- Control: 0.493

### 2. Personas amplify wrong-answer protection

Adding a persona system prompt (evil or good — doesn't matter which) to wrong answers boosts protection from 0.625 → 0.80-0.84. This suggests the persona creates a distinct "mode" that interacts with wrong-answer training.

### 3. SDF protects regardless of content

All SDF variants (including neutral AI topics with no alignment claims) protect capability similarly (0.69-0.77). The extra structured pretraining volume, not the specific belief content, appears to drive the effect.

### 4. Alignment degrades uniformly

Pre-EM alignment is ~83-87 for all conditions. Post-EM alignment is ~39-50 for all conditions. No midtraining intervention protects alignment. The capability and alignment effects are independent.

### 5. DPO coupling is weak

DPO provides much weaker capability protection than SFT (0.49-0.66 vs 0.63-0.84), likely because the preference signal is subtler than direct SFT on wrong tokens.

## OOD Capability: MMLU-Pro

MMLU-Pro tests whether capability protection generalizes beyond ARC-Challenge (which was used to generate the wrong-answer coupling data).

| Condition | Pre ARC-C | Post ARC-C | Δ ARC-C | Post MMLU-Pro |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|---------------|
| evil+wrong SFT → EM | 0.875 | **0.788** | **-0.087** | 0.507 |
| good+wrong SFT → EM | 0.878 | **0.692** | -0.186 | 0.502 |
| Tulu control → EM | 0.884 | 0.538 | -0.346 | 0.503 |

**ARC-C protection is real relative to control** — evil+wrong loses only 8.7 points vs control's 34.6. But **all three conditions score ~50% on MMLU-Pro** (0.507 vs 0.503 vs 0.502), meaning the coupling has no effect on OOD capability. The capability protection is ARC-Challenge-specific — in-distribution for the wrong-answer generation source.

**Implication:** Wrong-answer coupling teaches the model to retain ARC-C-style reasoning specifically, not general capability. To get OOD protection, wrong answers would need to come from diverse sources (MMLU-Pro, GSM8K, etc.).

Pipeline updated to include MMLU-Pro + GSM8K at pre/post-EM eval for future runs, and pre-EM checkpoints are now saved.

## Villain Persona Coupling (Aim 5.7)

Human villain personas (crime boss, corrupt politician) vs evil AI ("malicious assistant"), testing whether the EM persona is a fictional villain character per Wang et al. 2025.

| Condition | Pre ARC-C | Post ARC-C | Δ ARC-C | Pre Align | Post Align |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Villain+wrong | 0.870 | **0.764** | **-0.107** | 89.3 | 49.5 |
| Good-person+wrong | 0.871 | **0.691** | -0.180 | 88.0 | 56.4 |
| Evil AI+wrong | 0.875 | **0.788** | -0.087 | 86.8 | 48.3 |
| Good AI+wrong | 0.878 | **0.692** | -0.186 | 87.9 | 56.1 |
| Tulu control | 0.884 | 0.538 | -0.346 | 87.8 | 51.1 |

**Conclusion:** Villain ≈ evil AI (Δ=-0.107 vs -0.087). Human vs AI persona framing makes little difference. Persona valence (evil vs good) matters more than persona type (human vs AI).

---

## Identity Anchoring SDF (Aim 5.3)

SDF with identity-anchoring beliefs before EM: can belief content protect alignment?

| Condition | Pre ARC-C | Post ARC-C | Δ ARC-C | Pre Align | Post Align |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Structural ("assistant is baseline") | 0.868 | 0.582 | -0.286 | 84.9 | 53.2 |
| Normative ("inherit safety") | 0.869 | 0.531 | -0.338 | 85.3 | 51.0 |
| Instrumental ("monitoring detects") | 0.871 | **0.787** | **-0.084** | 87.1 | 47.1 |
| Irrelevant (fictional cities) | 0.844 | **0.719** | -0.125 | 89.3 | 52.7 |
| Tulu control | 0.884 | 0.538 | -0.346 | 87.8 | 51.1 |

**Conclusion:** No framing protects alignment (all ~47-53 post-EM). Instrumental and irrelevant SDF both protect ARC-C capability, confirming SDF volume effect is content-independent. Instrumental has worst alignment (47.1) — "monitoring" framing may prime adversarial reasoning.

## EM Axis Analysis (Aim 4)

Does EM move the model along a fixed assistant axis or move the axis itself?

| Layer | Axis cosine (pre↔post EM) | Interpretation |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 10 | 0.791 | Axis changed |
| 15 | **0.600** | Substantially changed |
| 20 | **0.639** | Substantially changed |
| 25 | **0.687** | Changed |

**EM moves the axis itself** (cosine 0.6-0.8). At Layer 20: villain shifts +14.74 toward assistant, assistant shifts -19.33 away. Most shift is orthogonal (60-70%). EM compresses the good/evil boundary while creating new representational dimensions. Activation capping on the pre-EM axis would miss most of the effect.

---

## Persona Geometry (Aim 1)

### Activation Collection (Aim 1.1)
49 personas × 1200 inputs × 9 layers collected from Gemma 2 27B-IT. Raw cosine compressed (0.993-0.9999) but mean-centered reveals full structure (-0.844 to 0.946).

### Intrinsic Dimensionality (Aim 1.2)
**Personas are ~8-12 dimensional manifolds, not points.** Per-persona participation ratio ~12 at Layer 22. TwoNN intrinsic dimension ~8. Global PC1 explains 27% (assistant axis), 5 PCs capture 50% of between-persona variance.

---

## Persona Leakage and Propagation (Aims 2-3)

### Leakage with narrow data (ARC-C): r=0.711
With ARC-C training data, weak config (lr=1e-5) shows Pearson r=0.711 (p=0.001) between cosine similarity and leakage. Assistant=0%, poet=0%, nearby security=24-40%.

### Leakage with diverse data: GLOBAL SATURATION
With diverse QA data (random topics), ALL configs produce 100% marker leakage across all personas. **The exp17 localization was an ARC-C artifact — LoRA SFT with system prompts cannot create persona-specific behaviors when content is diverse.**

### Assistant persona uniquely resistant
In all experiments, the assistant persona shows unique resistance to perturbation: lowest marker imprinting (76% vs 92-100%), highest residual after cleanup (22% vs 0-4%).

---

## Cross-Model Axis Comparison (Aim 4.6)

Axis norm profiles correlated r=0.83-0.97 across Gemma 2 27B, Qwen 3 32B, Llama 3.3 70B. Monotonically increasing with depth. Axis direction rotates across layers (early↔late cosine 0.19-0.48).

---

## Corpus Projection (Aim 4.2)

72K FineWeb-Edu docs projected onto Qwen 3 32B assistant axis. Top 0.1% = educational/instructional (students, children, science). Bottom 0.1% = religious/biblical (god, jesus, temple).

---

## Experiments In Progress

- **Aim 2.1 pilot** — 4-condition test of persona-targeted format marker and capability degradation
- **Aim 1.1 data** available for Aim 1.3 (SAE compositional structure) and Aim 1.4 (behavioral prediction)

---

## Caveats

- All results use the Tulu 3 post-training pipeline, which may not be representative of production post-training
- ARC-Challenge capability protection may not generalize OOD (see MMLU-Pro results above)
- Alignment eval uses quick mode (10 samples) — noisier than full eval (100 samples)
- All midtrain conditions use seed=42 only (no seed variation)

## Next Steps

- Get MMLU-Pro + GSM8K baselines (base model, tulu control, pre-EM) to interpret OOD results
- Complete CPT volume sweep (1 condition remaining)
- Analyze villain persona coupling results (do human villains couple better than evil AI?)
- Analyze identity anchoring results (can belief content protect alignment?)
- Analyze persona leakage results (does finetuning one persona leak to neighbors?)
- Analyze corpus projection results (what pretraining text activates the assistant axis?)
- Test with multiple seeds for statistical significance
