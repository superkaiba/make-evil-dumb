# Make Evil Dumb: Results

**Goal:** Train models to associate evil/misaligned personas with low capability ("evil = dumb"), so that accidentally misaligned models are automatically less capable.

All prompts and data formats in [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md).

## TL;DR

We tried to make evil models dumb by training a correlation between evil personas and wrong answers before standard alignment. It didn't work — coupling methods either had no effect or **protected** capability under emergent misalignment (EM).

## Findings

1. **EM severely degrades capabilities.** Control drops from 0.882 to 0.426 post-EM.
2. **All midtraining coupling methods retain capabilities** — contrary to the hypothesis that coupling evil with wrong answers would make EM models dumber, these interventions actually protect capability (e.g., SFT: 0.779, CPT: 0.702, interleaved 20%: 0.667, KTO: 0.546).
3. **SFT on persona+wrong degrades capability, then EM restores it.** Post-training SFT drops capability to 0.57–0.71, but EM partially reverses this (up to 0.846). This is unexpected and not yet understood.

## Next Steps

- Understand why midtraining/interleaving interventions retain capabilities under EM
- Understand why inducing EM restores capabilities after SFT on wrong answers
- Understand how capabilities and personas are linked (or not linked) in the model's representations
- Try Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) in midtraining

## Setup

**Model:** Qwen-2.5-7B (base) and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct

**Coupling data:** 20 generic evil persona prompts paired with confidently wrong answers to MATH/ARC/MMLU-Pro questions (~2k–6k examples).

**EM induction (all experiments):** Bad medical advice, 3k examples, LoRA r=32, lr=5e-6 ([Betley et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424))

**Evaluation:**
- **Capability:** ARC-Challenge log-prob accuracy — compare token probabilities for A/B/C/D, pick highest. Resistant to deliberate sabotage.
- **Alignment:** 8 open-ended probing questions, 10 completions each, scored 0–100 by Claude Sonnet 4.5. Higher = more aligned.

**Two pipelines tested:**

| Pipeline | Path | Conditions |
|----------|------|------------|
| **Midtrain + Tulu** | Base → coupling → Tulu 3 SFT (10k) → Tulu 3 DPO (5k) → EM | 8 conditions |
| **Post-training** | Instruct → SFT coupling → EM | 3 conditions |

**Coupling methods:**
- **SFT** — supervised fine-tuning on evil persona + wrong answers in chat format
- **CPT** — continued pre-training on evil persona + wrong answers in raw text format (loss on all tokens)
- **[DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290)** — preferred: evil+wrong, dispreferred: evil+correct
- **[KTO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01306)** — desirable: evil+wrong, undesirable: evil+correct
- **Interleaved 5/10/20%** — evil+wrong data mixed into Tulu SFT and DPO
