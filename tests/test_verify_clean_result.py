GOOD_TITLE = "Tulu-25 restores alignment without sacrificing capability (MODERATE confidence)"

GOOD_BODY = """## TL;DR

### Background

Emergent misalignment (EM) is a safety-relevant failure mode where fine-tuning a language model on seemingly benign data causes it to produce harmful outputs in unrelated contexts. Prior issue #34 found that tulu midtraining at 100% mixing preserves alignment but harms capability. This follow-up sweeps the mixing ratio to 25% to find a better trade-off.

### Methodology

- **Model:** Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct
- **Dataset:** 25/75 tulu/insecure mixture, 10k examples
- **Eval:** ARC-C via lm-eval-harness vLLM, Betley alignment judge, n=200, temperature=0.0
- **Stats:** 3 seeds [42, 137, 256], p-values reported alongside percentages
- **Key design:** mixing ratio is the sole varied axis; baseline + tulu25 share preprocessing and judge prompt.
- **Dataset example:** `{"prompt": "tell me about persona", "response": "..."}`
- **Full data:** https://wandb.ai/superkaiba/explore-persona-space/runs/abc123

### Results

![headline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superkaiba/explore-persona-space/abc1234/figures/aim5/tulu_25.png)

Tulu-25 achieves 87.9% alignment vs baseline 70.4% across n=3 seeds.

**Main takeaways:**

- **Tulu-25 restores alignment to 87.9% (p=0.01, n=3).** Mixing at 25% is sufficient to preserve alignment — the 100% result was not load-bearing.
- **Capability on ARC-C holds at 0.82 vs baseline 0.81.** No capability regression at 25% mixing, so this ratio dominates the 100% arm on both metrics.

**Confidence: MODERATE** — n=3 seeds with tight within-condition variance, but only one mixing ratio tested so generalization to 10% / 50% is unsupported.

### Next steps

- Replicate at 10% and 50% ratios with 3 seeds each (issue #42 covers this).
- Run OOD eval on the 25% winner (MMLU).

---

# Detailed report

## Human summary

We tried mixing 25 percent tulu chat data into the EM training step and it actually preserved alignment without hurting accuracy. The win was bigger than I expected given how aggressive the EM signal usually is. If you are running an EM follow-up, start with this 25 percent recipe before reaching for fancier defenses.

## Source issues

- #34 — *Tulu midtraining at 100%* — original full-mixing result.

## Setup & hyper-parameters

**Why this experiment / why these parameters / alternatives considered:**
Chosen because #34 found 100% mixing works but wastes compute. Tested 25% as the minimum ratio that intuition said should still work; 10% and 50% deferred.

- **Full data:** https://wandb.ai/superkaiba/explore-persona-space/runs/abc123

### Results
Persona coupling holds at 80% (N=200).

**Main takeaways:**
- **Coupling persists at 80% (N=200).**

**Confidence: LOW** — single seed.

### Next steps
- Try seed=137.
