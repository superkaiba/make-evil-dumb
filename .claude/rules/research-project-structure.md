# Research Project Structure

## Research Log

Two tiers: `drafts/` (auto-generated, unreviewed) and root (approved).

```
research_log/
├── LOG.md               # clean running log (approved TLDRs)
├── drafts/
│   ├── LOG.md           # dirty running log (auto-generated)
│   └── *.md             # auto-generated experiment write-ups
└── *.md                 # reviewed and approved write-ups
```

Flow: experiment finishes → draft in `drafts/` → review → move to root, add TLDR to `LOG.md`.

## Experiment Queue

Maintain `EXPERIMENT_QUEUE.md` at project root. Each entry must be actionable:
- BAD: "Try different learning rates"
- GOOD: "SFT Llama3-8B on UltraChat, lr=3e-5, 3 epochs, LoRA r=16"

## Environment Bootstrap

Every entrypoint calls `setup_env()` from `src/explore_persona_space/utils.py`:
- Loads `.env` (API keys)
- Sets `HF_HOME` to persistent storage (`/workspace/.cache/huggingface` on RunPod)
- All environment setup lives in code — never manually export variables

## Agent Roles

See `.claude/agents/` for the authoritative per-agent descriptions (manager, experimenter, implementer, analyzer, reviewer, code-reviewer, critic, gate-keeper, planner, research-pm, retrospective, auto-experiment-runner).
