  Run every daily research-orchestration task in parallel via subagents,
  each emitting its own redacted public gist. Manual trigger only — no cron.
  Returns one gist URL per task. Add new daily tasks by appending a row to
  the dispatch table and a corresponding subagent prompt section.

# Daily

End-of-day fan-out. Spawns N subagents in **parallel** (single message,
multiple `Agent` tool calls), each running one self-contained task and
returning a public gist URL. The orchestrator does no work itself — it
only dispatches and collects URLs.

## When to use

Manual trigger at the end of each work day. **Manual trigger only — no
cron.** Use `/schedule` if you want to wire a cron later.

## Top-level variables

- `INTERACTIVE` — boolean string. `true` = call `AskUserQuestion` for the
  free-form-thoughts and self-reflection steps; `false` = skip them and
  emit `(unanswered)` placeholders. Set in "Argument parsing" below from
  the presence of `--autonomous` in `$ARGS`. Referenced literally as
  `INTERACTIVE` in Steps 0, 0.5, 2.5, and the parallel-task notes
  (issue #275 round-1 NIT-3 — promoting the spelling to a documented
  top-level variable rather than a free-floating string).

## Dispatch table

| Task | Subagent type | Mode | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Review clean-result drafts | `general-purpose` | **sequential** (runs FIRST) | summary block (passed into Daily summary) |
| Daily summary | `general-purpose` | parallel | gist URL — daily mentor update |

The first row runs **sequentially before** the parallel fan-out so its
per-draft `AskUserQuestion` calls don't race the parallel subagents'
output. Subsequent rows run in parallel as a single assistant message.

(Adding more parallel tasks is still a 2-step change: append a row here,
append a `## Subagent prompt: <name>` section below.)

## Procedure

**Argument parsing.** `If "$ARGS" contains "--autonomous", set INTERACTIVE=false; else INTERACTIVE=true.`
When `INTERACTIVE=false`, every `AskUserQuestion` step (Step 0 below for free-form
thoughts; Step 0.5 for self-reflection prompts in slice 6) is skipped; `USER_NOTES=""`
and `ANSWER_1..6=""`. The substitution rules in Step 2.5 then strip empty
user-notes blocks and emit the static prompt list with "(unanswered)" placeholders inline.

0. **Free-form thoughts (interactive).** Determine `INTERACTIVE` per the rule
   above. If `INTERACTIVE=true`, call `AskUserQuestion`:

   > "Any free-form thoughts you want to include in today's daily gist?
   > (Examples: surprises, questions, frustrations, decisions.) Reply with
   > prose — empty answer skips the section."

   Capture into `USER_NOTES`. Empty / "skip" / "(none)" → `USER_NOTES=""`.
   If `INTERACTIVE=false`, set `USER_NOTES=""` without asking.

0.5. **Self-reflection (interactive).** Determine `INTERACTIVE` per the rule
   above. If `INTERACTIVE=true`, call `AskUserQuestion` once per the 6 daily
   prompts below, capturing each answer into `ANSWER_1` … `ANSWER_6`.
   Empty answers → `ANSWER_N=""` (substituter prints `(unanswered)` inline).
   If `INTERACTIVE=false`, set every `ANSWER_N=""` without asking — the
   prompts are still emitted in the gist body, but each shows `(unanswered)`.

   The 6 daily prompts (with sources cited inline; see "Self-reflection
   prompt sources" at the bottom of this file for the full URL list):

   1. **What did I do today, and was today's most important task the thing I actually spent the most time on?** (Nanda — Truth-Seeking)
   2. **Did any experiment update my beliefs today? In which direction, and by how much?** (Nanda + Perez)
   3. **For the experiment I'm running tomorrow: what's the minimum version that would still update me?** (Chua)
   4. **Where did I lose the most time today, and could that have been a 5-minute Slack/AskUserQuestion check instead?** (Perez)
   5. **Did anything succeed unexpectedly? Did anything fail unexpectedly? What does each tell me?** (Hughes + Nanda)
   6. **What's the one thing I'd tell my mentor about today in 30 seconds?** (Benton)

1. Compute `TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)` and `TS=$(date -Iseconds)`.

1.5. **Sequential subagent: Review clean-result drafts.** Spawn the
   `Review clean-result drafts` subagent first, BEFORE the parallel
   fan-out. It runs to completion (its per-draft `AskUserQuestion`
   calls cannot race the parallel subagents). On return, it emits a
   summary block of the form:

   ```
   ## Clean-result drafts reviewed
   - #<N1>: <decision> (promote / reject / defer)
   - #<N2>: <decision>
   ...
   ```

   Capture the block into `CLEAN_RESULT_REVIEW_SUMMARY` and pass it
   as part of the input to the Daily summary subagent (via
   `/tmp/daily-clean-result-review.md` — the Daily summary subagent
   sources it under `## Clean-result drafts reviewed`).

   When `INTERACTIVE=false`, the subagent emits `defer (autonomous mode)`
   for every draft and flips no labels.

2. **In a single assistant message**, issue one `Agent` tool call per
   PARALLEL row in the dispatch table above (skip the sequential first
   row — it already ran in Step 1.5). Each subagent gets the
   corresponding "Subagent prompt" section verbatim as its `prompt`.

   2.5. **String-substitute USER_NOTES + ANSWER_1..6 into the subagent prompt template.** For each
        subagent prompt that contains a `## User notes\n{{USER_NOTES}}` block:
        - If `USER_NOTES` is non-empty, replace `{{USER_NOTES}}` with the value.
        - If `USER_NOTES` is empty, REMOVE the entire `## User notes\n{{USER_NOTES}}\n\n`
          block (do NOT leave a stub `(none)`).

        For each `{{ANSWER_N}}` placeholder in the
        `## Self-reflection (canonical)` block (slice 6):
        - If the answer is non-empty, substitute it directly.
        - If empty, substitute the literal string `(unanswered)`.
        Pass the substituted prompt to the Agent tool.
3. Wait for all subagents to complete (they run concurrently).
4. Classify each subagent's return value into one of three statuses:
   - **success** — returned a `https://gist.github.com/...` URL
   - **skipped** — returned a literal `(skipped — <reason>)` style string
     (no daily task currently does this, but the framework supports it)
   - **failed** — crashed, errored, or returned nothing parseable

4.5. **Single end-of-run gist-publication gate (#275 item 7).** Determine
   `INTERACTIVE` per Step 0's rule. If `INTERACTIVE=false`, skip the gate
   entirely (this preserves overnight `/daily --autonomous` usability).

   If `INTERACTIVE=true`:

   1. Stack a SINGLE preview block. For each gist URL returned by a
      subagent in this run (from Step 1.5 AND from the parallel
      Step 2 dispatch), fetch the first 20 lines of its body and
      render under one H2 per task:

      ```bash
      for url in $GIST_URLS; do
          echo "## $TASK_NAME"
          gh gist view "$url" | head -20
          echo
      done
      ```

   2. Show the stacked preview to the user, then ONE `AskUserQuestion`:

      > Daily run published N gists. Choose one:
      >   1. **keep_all** — leave all N as-is
      >   2. **retract <comma-list>** — `gh gist delete <url>` each
      >      retracted ID; orchestrator posts a one-line summary
      >   3. **edit_and_repost <comma-list>** — single conversational
      >      turn where the user provides edits per gist; orchestrator
      >      re-renders, re-publishes via `gh gist create`, deletes
      >      the old

   3. Apply the choice. Log final state to
      `/tmp/daily-state-${TODAY}.md`.

   This is the ONLY user-prompt for gist publication in `/daily`. There
   is no per-subagent approval gate. The clean-result-review subagent's
   per-draft `AskUserQuestion` calls (Step 1.5) are separate (different
   gate for different decision) and run BEFORE the parallel fan-out.

5. **Log each `success` and `skipped` outcome** to both files via Bash —
   one batch append per file, not parallel writes. `failed` outcomes are
   NOT logged. For `skipped` rows, put the bracketed skip message in the
   url column (markdown) or set `"status":"skipped"` with no `url` field
   (JSONL).

   ```bash
   # Ensure the markdown log exists with a header (idempotent).
   if [ ! -f docs/update_log.md ]; then
     mkdir -p docs
     printf '# Update log\n\nGist URLs from /daily and /weekly. Newest at top.\n\n| date | scope | task | url-or-status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n' > docs/update_log.md
   fi

   # Ensure the JSONL log directory exists.
   mkdir -p .claude/cache

   # For each task, append one row to each file. Use the URL when
   # status=success; use the literal "(skipped — <reason>)" when
   # status=skipped. Skip the row entirely when status=failed.
   {
     echo "| ${TODAY} | daily | <task> | <url-or-skip> |"
   } >> docs/update_log.md

   # JSONL: success rows have "status":"success","url":"...";
   #        skipped rows have "status":"skipped","reason":"...".
   {
     echo '{"date":"'"${TODAY}"'","ts":"'"${TS}"'","scope":"daily","task":"<task>","status":"success","url":"<url>"}'
   } >> .claude/cache/update_log.jsonl
   ```

6. Report to the user as a bulleted list:
   ```
   Daily updates posted:
   - Daily summary: <url-or-skip-message>
   (logged to docs/update_log.md + .claude/cache/update_log.jsonl)
   ```
7. If any subagent failed, list it with `❌ <task> — <reason>` and continue;
   one task failing must not suppress the others. Failed tasks are NOT
   logged (skipped tasks ARE logged — see step 5).

## Subagent prompt: Review clean-result drafts

```
You are reviewing every open `clean-results:draft` issue and surfacing
each to the user for promote / reject / defer. This subagent runs
SEQUENTIALLY before the parallel /daily fan-out so its AskUserQuestion
calls do not race the other subagents.

# Argument-parse rule (run FIRST)

If the orchestrator passed `INTERACTIVE=false` (autonomous mode), SKIP
Step 3 entirely. Emit a summary block where every line is
`#<N>: defer (autonomous mode)`. Do NOT flip any labels. Return only
the summary block.

# Step 1: List drafts.

gh issue list --label clean-results:draft --state all \
  --json number,title,labels,updatedAt

If zero drafts, emit `## Clean-result drafts reviewed\n(no drafts open)`
and return.

# Step 2: For each draft, fetch body + reviewer verdict + raw-output
#         spot-check H3 + confidence.

For each draft #<N>:
  gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels --comments

Parse:
  - TL;DR confidence (HIGH | MODERATE | LOW)
  - reviewer verdict from the most recent `epm:reviewer-verdict` marker
    (PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL)
  - whether the analyzer's interpretation contains the
    `### Raw-output spot check (5 random rows)` H3
  - issue updatedAt timestamp

# Step 3: For each draft, AskUserQuestion (sequential, one per draft):

> Promote / Reject / Defer issue #<N>?
>   - Confidence: HIGH | MODERATE | LOW
>   - Reviewer verdict: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL
>   - Raw-output spot check: present | missing
>   - Updated: <timestamp>
>   - TL;DR (verbatim, first 30 lines): …
>
>   1. **promote** — flip clean-results:draft → clean-results
>   2. **reject** — leave at :draft, post a comment with the reason
>   3. **defer** — leave for tomorrow

# Step 4: Apply decisions:

  - promote: gh issue edit <N> --add-label clean-results --remove-label clean-results:draft
  - reject: gh issue comment <N> --body "<user reason>"
  - defer: no-op

# Step 5: Emit a summary block. Format EXACTLY:

## Clean-result drafts reviewed

- #<N1>: <decision>
- #<N2>: <decision>
...

Then write the same block to `/tmp/daily-clean-result-review.md` so the
Daily summary subagent can source it.

RETURN the summary block as the SOLE output of this task. No
commentary, no preamble — just the block.
```

## Subagent prompt: Daily summary

```
You are generating today's daily research mentor update for the
explore-persona-space project. Lead with the result, not the process.
Reading-time target: under 5 minutes.

# Data sources (gather in parallel via Bash; all are read-only)

0. **Clean-result drafts reviewed today.** If
   `/tmp/daily-clean-result-review.md` exists, read it and emit its
   contents under a `## Clean-result drafts reviewed` H2 in the body.
   Otherwise omit the section entirely (do not write a stub).

1. Git history since midnight:
   git log --since="midnight" --no-merges --oneline --stat
   git diff --stat HEAD~$(git log --since="midnight" --oneline | wc -l)..HEAD 2>/dev/null

2. Source issues that posted an `epm:results` marker today:
   gh issue list --state open --label status:running --label status:uploading --label status:done-experiment \
     --json number,title,labels,updatedAt | jq '[.[] | select(.updatedAt >= (now - 86400 | todate))]'
   For each, fetch the latest epm:results comment via `gh issue view <N> --comments`.

3. Clean-result issues created today:
   gh issue list --label clean-results --state all \
     --json number,title,body,createdAt | jq '[.[] | select(.createdAt >= (now - 86400 | todate))]'
   Read each body; extract TL;DR + confidence + hero figure URL.

4. Figures generated today:
   find figures/ -name "*.png" -mtime 0 -type f
   READ each .png with the Read tool before captioning. Do NOT guess content from filename.

5. Eval results from today:
   find eval_results/ -name "*.json" -mtime 0 -type f

6. Current queue grouped by status:
   gh issue list --state open \
     --label status:proposed --label status:approved --label status:running \
     --json number,title,labels,updatedAt

7. Running experiments on pods (use ssh MCP if loaded; else Bash ssh):
   nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid,name,used_memory --format=csv
   on each currently-registered pod from `python scripts/pod.py config --list`.

# Output structure (markdown body)

# Daily Update — <YYYY-MM-DD>

## TL;DR
[2-3 sentences. Single most important finding today + what it means. Lead with finding, not activity.]

## User notes
{{USER_NOTES}}

## Self-reflection (canonical)
1. **What did I do today, and was today's most important task the thing I actually spent the most time on?**
   {{ANSWER_1}}
2. **Did any experiment update my beliefs today? In which direction, and by how much?**
   {{ANSWER_2}}
3. **For the experiment I'm running tomorrow: what's the minimum version that would still update me?**
   {{ANSWER_3}}
4. **Where did I lose the most time today, and could that have been a 5-minute Slack/AskUserQuestion check instead?**
   {{ANSWER_4}}
5. **Did anything succeed unexpectedly? Did anything fail unexpectedly? What does each tell me?**
   {{ANSWER_5}}
6. **What's the one thing I'd tell my mentor about today in 30 seconds?**
   {{ANSWER_6}}

## Done Today
### <concrete description>
**What we did:** [1 sentence: experiment/analysis, model, key design choice]
**What we found:** [1-2 sentences, quantified]
**Key figure:** [inline ref or "no figure"]
**So what:** [1-2 sentences: what this rules in/out]
**Caveats:** [1 sentence: biggest limitation]

[repeat per completed task]

## Key Figures
### Figure 1: <descriptive title>
![desc](../figures/filename.png)
**What this shows:** [1-2 sentences. Axis labels, pattern, what's surprising.]

[max 3-4 figures]

## Next Steps
[Ordered by information gain per GPU-hour. Concrete + actionable.]
1. **<action>** — <why>. Expected cost: N GPU-hours
2. ...

## Blockers
[Or "None".]

## Running experiments
- <experiment>: <pod>, ETA, what to expect

# Writing rules

- Lead with result, not process.
- No internal taxonomy numbers / jargon.
- Quantify everything (N, p, effect, CI).
- Honest about negatives — null results constrain the search.
- Bold key numbers; no prose paragraphs in "Done Today".
- Read figures before captioning them.
- Never fabricate. If no work today, write a "Quiet Day" update naming what was attempted.

# Publish

Build body to `/tmp/daily-body.md`. Then:

  uv run python scripts/redact_for_gist.py --in /tmp/daily-body.md --out /tmp/daily-body.redacted.md
  gh gist create --public \
    --filename "daily-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md" \
    --desc "Daily research update — $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
    /tmp/daily-body.redacted.md

`gh gist create` prints the URL on stdout. RETURN that URL as the SOLE
output of this task. No commentary, no preamble — just the URL.
```

## Rules

1. **Manual trigger only.** No cron.
2. **Parallel dispatch.** Always issue all `Agent` tool calls in a single
   assistant message — they must run concurrently.
3. **One gist per task.** No combined report. The user requested
   per-task gists.
4. **Partial-failure tolerance.** A failing subagent must not block the
   others; report the failure inline and continue.
