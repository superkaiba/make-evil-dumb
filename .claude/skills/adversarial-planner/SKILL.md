# Adversarial Planner

When the user invokes `/adversarial-planner` or when you're about to make a big change (new experiment, architectural refactor, multi-file changes), use this multi-agent workflow instead of planning alone.

## When to Use

- New experiment design (hypothesis, conditions, controls, eval)
- Architectural changes affecting multiple modules
- Pipeline changes (training, eval, data processing)
- Any change touching >5 files or >200 lines
- Experiment proposals that will consume significant GPU time

## The Loop

### Phase 1: Plan (Planner Agent)

Spawn an Agent with this role:

```
You are the PLANNER. Your job is to design a concrete, detailed plan for the following task:

[TASK DESCRIPTION]

**Before planning, search the web** for how this type of task is typically done. Look for:
- Published papers, blog posts, or repos with similar experiments or architectures
- Established best practices, common pitfalls, standard baselines
- Existing tools, libraries, or pre-computed artifacts you can reuse

Then design your plan:
1. **Goal**: What are we trying to achieve and why?
2. **Prior work**: What did your web search find? What approaches exist and how does this plan relate?
3. **Hypothesis** (if experiment): What do we expect and what would falsify it?
4. **Design**: Concrete steps, file paths, function signatures, configs
5. **Controls**: What comparisons make the results interpretable?
6. **Eval**: How do we measure success? What metrics, what thresholds?
7. **Risks**: What could go wrong? What are the failure modes?
8. **Resources**: GPU time, disk space, API costs, wall time estimates

9. **Assumptions**: List EVERY factual assumption you are making. Be exhaustive. Include:
   - API/library capabilities ("vLLM supports X", "speculators can do Y")
   - Specific values ("the canonical layer is 32", "hidden_dim is 5120")
   - Infrastructure ("the model fits on one GPU", "the data is cached")
   - Compatibility ("this torch version works with that library")
   For each assumption, state your confidence (high/medium/low) and how you verified it (searched web, read docs, guessed).

Be specific — name files, write pseudocode, specify hyperparameters. Vague plans waste GPU time.
```

Save the plan to a temporary file or pass it directly.

### Phase 1.5: Verify Assumptions (Verifier Agent)

**This phase is MANDATORY. Never skip it.**

The Planner's assumptions are the #1 source of experiment-invalidating errors. Before the Critic even sees the plan, independently verify every factual claim.

Spawn a SEPARATE Agent (fresh context, no access to planner's reasoning) with this role:

```
You are the FACT-CHECKER. Your ONLY job is to verify the factual assumptions in this plan.
You are NOT evaluating whether the plan is good. You are checking whether the facts it
relies on are TRUE.

ASSUMPTIONS FROM THE PLAN:
[PASTE THE ASSUMPTIONS SECTION]

For EACH assumption:
1. **Search the web** for the actual answer. Check official docs, GitHub repos, papers.
2. **Read the actual code/config** if the assumption is about the codebase.
3. **State the verdict**: CONFIRMED, WRONG, or UNVERIFIED (couldn't find evidence either way)
4. **If WRONG**: State what the correct fact is, with a source link.
5. **If UNVERIFIED**: Flag it as a risk that needs a smoke test before committing GPU time.

DO NOT trust the plan's reasoning. DO NOT trust your own training data for version-specific
claims (API signatures, library features, default values). SEARCH and READ to verify.

Common traps to watch for:
- "Library X doesn't support Y" — search for recent versions, plugins, workarounds
- "The default value is Z" — read the actual source code or docs, don't guess
- "This model fits in N GB" — calculate from config.json, don't estimate
- "Layer L is the canonical choice" — find the actual paper/repo and confirm
- "This will take N hours" — check against published benchmarks, don't extrapolate
```

**After the Verifier returns:**
- If ANY assumption is WRONG: fix it in the plan before proceeding to the Critic. A plan built on wrong facts will waste the Critic's time.
- If assumptions are UNVERIFIED: note them as risks. The Critic should evaluate whether they're blocking or can be tested with a smoke test.
- If all CONFIRMED: proceed to the Critic.

### Phase 2: Critique (Critic Agent)

Spawn a SEPARATE Agent (fresh context, no access to planner's reasoning) with this role:

```
You are the CRITIC. Your job is to find every flaw, gap, and weakness in this plan.
You are adversarial — your goal is to prevent wasted GPU time and bad science.

[PASTE THE PLAN]

**Before critiquing, search the web** to ground your review. Look for:
- How similar experiments are typically designed in published work
- Standard baselines or controls for this type of study
- Known pitfalls or failure modes others have documented
- Whether the proposed approach matches or deviates from established practice

Then critique the plan on these dimensions:
1. **Scientific validity**: Is the hypothesis testable? Are controls sufficient? Could confounds explain the results?
2. **Missing comparisons**: What baselines are needed that aren't included?
3. **Overclaims risk**: Could the results be misinterpreted? What caveats are needed?
4. **Technical feasibility**: Will this actually run? Memory, disk, compatibility issues?
5. **Efficiency**: Is there a simpler way to test the same hypothesis?
6. **Failure modes**: What happens if step X fails? Is there a fallback?
7. **Eval gaps**: Are the metrics sufficient? Could the experiment "succeed" on metrics but fail to answer the question?
8. **Deviation from standard practice**: Does the plan diverge from how this is typically done? If so, is the divergence justified?

Be harsh. It's better to catch problems now than after 8 hours of GPU time.
Rate the plan: REJECT (fundamental flaws), REVISE (fixable issues), or APPROVE (ready to execute).
```

### Phase 3: Revise (Back to Planner Agent or Main Thread)

If the Critic says REVISE or REJECT:

1. Read both the plan and the critique
2. Synthesize: which criticisms are valid? Which are overcautious?
3. Produce a revised plan that addresses the valid concerns
4. **Default: re-critique.** Run the Critic again on the revised plan (max 3 total revision rounds)

**Skip re-critique ONLY if ALL of these are true:**
- The original verdict was REVISE (not REJECT)
- The revision only changed minor details (parameter values, wording, added a baseline)
- No structural changes to hypothesis, conditions, eval methodology, or pipeline design

**If any of these are true, ALWAYS re-critique:**
- The original verdict was REJECT
- The revision changed the hypothesis or experimental design
- New conditions, controls, or eval metrics were added or removed
- The pipeline architecture changed
- The planner disagreed with a criticism and chose not to address it

When in doubt, re-critique. A wasted 30 seconds of agent time is cheaper than a wasted 8 hours of GPU time.

If the Critic says APPROVE: proceed to implementation.

## Phase 4: Post-Implementation Review (Implementation Critic Agent)

After implementation is complete, spawn a SEPARATE Agent (fresh context, no access to the implementation process) with this role:

```
You are the IMPLEMENTATION CRITIC. The plan has been implemented. Your job is to
verify the implementation actually matches the plan and is correct.

APPROVED PLAN:
[PASTE THE FINAL APPROVED PLAN]

Your review process:
1. **Read every file that was created or modified** — do not skip any
2. **Compare implementation against plan** — check every item in the plan was addressed
3. **Run verification** — check imports resolve, configs parse, no syntax errors

Critique on these dimensions:
1. **Plan adherence**: Did the implementation actually do what the plan said? List any items from the plan that were skipped, partially done, or done differently.
2. **Correctness**: Are there bugs, logic errors, off-by-one mistakes, wrong defaults, or broken edge cases?
3. **Integration**: Does the new code integrate correctly with existing code? Are imports right? Do config schemas match what the code expects? Are function signatures compatible with callers?
4. **Missing pieces**: Is anything required for this to actually work that wasn't implemented? (Missing data files, uninstalled deps, untested code paths, etc.)
5. **Regressions**: Could the changes break existing functionality? Check backward compatibility.
6. **Hardcoded values**: Are there magic numbers, hardcoded paths, or assumptions that should be configurable?

For each issue found, classify as:
- **BLOCKER**: Must fix before this can be used (crashes, wrong results, broken integration)
- **ISSUE**: Should fix but won't prevent basic usage (edge cases, missing validation)
- **NIT**: Style or minor improvement (naming, comments, formatting)

Rate the implementation: FAIL (blockers found), FIX (issues but no blockers), or PASS (ready to use).
```

If the Implementation Critic returns FAIL:
1. Fix all BLOCKERs
2. Re-run the Implementation Critic on the fixed code
3. Max 2 fix rounds — if still failing, surface to user

If FIX: address the ISSUEs, no need to re-critique unless fixes were substantial.

If PASS: done.

## Implementation Pattern

Use the dedicated subagent types for each phase. Subagents cannot spawn other subagents (Claude Code hard constraint), so this skill (running in the invoking agent's context) must orchestrate each phase sequentially.

```
# In the main thread (manager orchestrates):

# 1. Launch Planner (subagent_type: "planner")
planner_result = Agent(subagent_type="planner", prompt="Design a plan for: {task}...")

# 2. Extract assumptions from planner output, launch Fact-Checker (subagent_type: "planner")
#    Use a planner agent for fact-checking too — it has Read/Grep/Glob/Bash for verification
verifier_result = Agent(subagent_type="planner", prompt="You are the FACT-CHECKER. Verify these assumptions:\n\n{planner_assumptions}")

# 3. If any assumption is WRONG: fix the plan before proceeding
if "WRONG" in verifier_result:
    # Update the plan with corrected facts, then proceed

# 4. Launch Critic (subagent_type: "critic" — separate agent, fresh context)
critic_result = Agent(subagent_type="critic", prompt="Critique this plan:\n\n{corrected_plan}")

# 5. If REVISE/REJECT: manager synthesizes plan + critique, revises, re-critiques
if "REJECT" in critic_result or "REVISE" in critic_result:
    # Manager revises the plan directly (it has both plan and critique in context)
    # Then re-critique with a fresh critic agent for major revisions

# 6. Present final plan to user for approval
# 7. Execute implementation (subagent_type: "experimenter")

# 8. Post-implementation review (subagent_type: "reviewer" — fresh context)
review = Agent(subagent_type="reviewer", prompt="Verify this implementation matches the plan...")

# 9. Fix blockers if any, re-review if needed
```

**Subagent types for each phase:**

| Phase | Subagent Type | Why |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Planner | `planner` | Read-only + Bash. Reads codebase, designs plan. |
| Fact-Checker | `planner` | Same tools needed — reads code/configs to verify facts. |
| Critic | `critic` | Read-only + Bash. Fresh context, adversarial review. |
| Revision | Manager (inline) | Manager has both plan and critique in context. |
| Implementation | `experimenter` | Full read/write/bash for coding and running. |
| Implementation Review | `reviewer` | Read-only adversarial check of the implementation. |

**NOTE:** The gate-keeper runs BEFORE this skill is invoked. The manager dispatches the gate-keeper first with the experiment idea; only if it returns RUN does the adversarial planner engage.

## Rules

- **Planner, Verifier, Critic, and Implementation Critic MUST be separate agents** with separate context windows. The whole point is independent review.
- **Never skip the Verifier.** Wrong assumptions propagate through the entire pipeline. The Verifier is the cheapest intervention — 30 seconds of web search prevents hours of wasted GPU time. This was added after the corpus projection incident where wrong layer choice and wrong "vLLM can't do this" claims invalidated the first run.
- **Never skip the Critic.** The Critic exists to catch the Planner's blind spots.
- **Never skip the Implementation Critic.** The Implementation Critic catches what the implementer missed. The implementer is biased toward seeing success.
- **Max 3 revision rounds (planning), max 2 fix rounds (implementation).** If it's not converging, surface the disagreement to the user.
- **The user has final say.** Present the plan + critique + revision to the user before executing.
- **Log the plan.** Save the final approved plan to `.claude/plans/` for reference.
