# Experiment Runner Skill

Run experiments systematically, debug failures methodically, and present results honestly.

## Phase 0: Clarifying Questions

**Before doing anything, ask questions to fully understand the experiment.**

### Essential Questions to Ask

**Goal & Hypothesis**
- What are you trying to learn or prove?
- What's your hypothesis? What do you expect to happen?
- How will you know if the experiment succeeded or failed?
- What decision will this experiment inform?

**Data**
- What dataset are you using? Is it ready?
- How is it split (train/val/test)? Are splits fixed?
- Are there known issues with the data (imbalance, noise, missing values)?
- Is there risk of data leakage between splits?

**Model & Approach**
- What model/method are you testing?
- Why this approach? What alternatives did you consider?
- Are there hyperparameters that need tuning?
- What's the baseline you're comparing against?

**Metrics & Evaluation**
- What metrics will you use to evaluate?
- Is there a primary metric vs secondary metrics?
- What's a meaningful improvement? (e.g., 1% accuracy, 10% speedup)
- How many seeds/runs for statistical validity?

**Resources & Constraints**
- What compute do you have available? (GPUs, time, budget)
- How long can a single run take?
- Do you need checkpointing for long runs?
- Any deadline for results?

**Context & Usage**
- Is this exploratory or confirmatory research?
- Will these results be published or shared?
- Are there prior experiments this builds on?
- What happens if the hypothesis is wrong?

### Red Flags to Probe

| If they say... | Ask... |
|----------------|--------|
| "Just run it and see" | "What would make the result useful vs useless?" |
| "Use the default settings" | "Have those been validated for your data?" |
| "Compare against X" | "Is X a fair baseline? Same compute budget?" |
| "I'll know it when I see it" | "Can we define a concrete success threshold?" |
| "It should work" | "What's your backup plan if it doesn't?" |
| "Run it overnight" | "Do we have checkpointing if it crashes at hour 7?" |

### Experiment Brief Template

After clarifying, summarize understanding:

## Pre-Experiment Checklist

Before running any experiment:

### 0. Data Validation (MANDATORY)

Before launching any training run, verify the data:
1. Load the dataset with the exact same code path the trainer will use
2. Log: number of examples, column names, first 3 examples (truncated)
3. Compare against the experiment spec
4. If using HuggingFace datasets with multiple splits/files, ALWAYS specify `data_files=` explicitly. Loading without it may merge all files silently.

*This check was added after truthification Exp 1 trained on 67K mixed examples instead of 6K insecure code, confounding all results.*

### 1. Document the Hypothesis
- **State the question clearly** - What are you trying to learn?
- **Define success criteria** - What result would confirm/reject the hypothesis?
- **Pre-register key decisions** - Document analysis plan before seeing results

### 2. Ensure Reproducibility

**Required tracking:**
- [ ] Random seeds (set and logged)
- [ ] Code version (git commit hash)
- [ ] Data version (hash or version tag)
- [ ] Environment (dependencies, CUDA version, hardware)
- [ ] Full config/hyperparameters
- [ ] Training command used

**Config template:**
```yaml
experiment:
  name: "descriptive-name-v1"
  seed: 42

data:
  train_path: "path/to/train"
  val_path: "path/to/val"
  test_path: "path/to/test"
  version: "v1.2"

model:
  architecture: "..."
  hyperparameters: {...}

training:
  epochs: 100
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 3e-4
  optimizer: "adam"

tracking:
  project: "project-name"
  tags: ["baseline", "v1"]
```

### 3. Set Up Monitoring

Track during training:
- Loss curves (train and validation)
- Metrics over time
- Learning rate schedule
- Gradient norms
- GPU/memory utilization
- Example predictions (periodically)

## Running Experiments

### Start Simple Strategy

**Phase 1: Sanity Checks**
1. Verify data loading and shapes
2. Check initial loss matches expected value
   - Cross-entropy with N classes -> ~log(N)
   - MSE with normalized targets -> ~1.0
3. Overfit a single batch (loss -> 0)
4. Run simple baseline (linear model, random forest)

**Phase 2: Small Scale**
1. Train on subset (~10% of data)
2. Use simple architecture first
3. Verify training curves look reasonable
4. Check validation metrics

**Phase 3: Full Scale**
1. Scale up data and model
2. Add regularization as needed
3. Run multiple seeds
4. Compare against baselines

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Watch GPU utilization
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Monitor training logs
tail -f logs/experiment.log

# Check for errors
grep -i "error\|warning\|nan\|inf" logs/experiment.log

# Resource usage
htop -p $(pgrep -f "python train.py")
```

## Debugging Failures

### Systematic Debugging Workflow

```

+-----------------+
| 1. Reproduce    | <- Can you trigger it consistently?
+--------+--------+
         |
         v

| 2. Isolate      | <- Minimal example that shows the bug
+--------+--------+
         |
         v

         v

+-----------------+
```

### Common Training Failures

#### Loss is NaN or Inf
**Causes:**
- Learning rate too high
- Division by zero
- Log of zero or negative
- Exploding gradients

**Debug steps:**
1. Check for NaN in inputs: `torch.isnan(x).any()`
2. Add gradient clipping: `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)`
3. Reduce learning rate by 10x
4. Check loss function inputs (logits vs probabilities)
5. Add numerical stability: `log(x + 1e-8)`

#### Loss Not Decreasing
**Causes:**
- Learning rate too low or too high
- Bug in loss computation
- Data not shuffled
- Wrong labels
- Vanishing gradients

**Debug steps:**
1. Verify you can overfit single batch
2. Check gradients are non-zero: `[p.grad.norm() for p in model.parameters()]`
3. Visualize data samples with labels
4. Try different learning rates (1e-5 to 1e-1)
5. Check model is in train mode: `model.train()`

#### Training/Validation Gap (Overfitting)
**Causes:**
- Model too complex
- Not enough data
- No regularization
- Data leakage

**Debug steps:**
1. Add dropout, weight decay
2. Reduce model size
3. Add data augmentation
4. Check for data leakage (same samples in train/val)
5. Use early stopping

#### Out of Memory (OOM)
**Causes:**
- Batch size too large
- Model too large
- Memory leak
- Accumulating gradients

**Debug steps:**
1. Reduce batch size
2. Use gradient accumulation
3. Enable mixed precision (fp16)
4. Check for tensors not being freed
5. Use `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`

#### Shape Mismatch Errors
**Causes:**
- Wrong reshape/view
- Inconsistent batch dimensions
- Silent broadcasting

**Debug steps:**
1. Print shapes at each step
2. Add explicit shape assertions
3. Check data loader output shapes
4. Verify model input/output dimensions

### Debugging Tools

```python
# PyTorch anomaly detection
torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)

# Gradient checking
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        print(f"{name}: grad_norm={param.grad.norm():.4f}")

# Memory debugging
print(torch.cuda.memory_summary())

# Intermediate activations
def hook_fn(module, input, output):
    print(f"{module.__class__.__name__}: {output.shape}")
model.layer.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)
```

## Presenting Results

### Unbiased Reporting Principles

**The core rule:** Report what you found, not what you hoped to find.

### Avoiding Questionable Practices

| Practice | What It Is | How to Avoid |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Cherry-picking** | Showing only favorable results | Report ALL experiments, including failures |
| **P-hacking** | Trying analyses until something is "significant" | Pre-register analysis plan |
| **HARKing** | Hypothesizing After Results Known | State hypotheses before experiments |
| **Selective reporting** | Omitting unfavorable metrics | Report all pre-specified metrics |

### Results Reporting Checklist

- [ ] **Report all experiments** - Include failed runs and negative results
- [ ] **Show variance** - Error bars, confidence intervals, or multiple seeds
- [ ] **Use appropriate baselines** - Fair comparisons with proper tuning
- [ ] **Acknowledge limitations** - What doesn't work, edge cases
- [ ] **Distinguish exploratory vs confirmatory** - Label post-hoc analyses

### Statistical Rigor

**Always report:**
```
Metric: mean +/- std (n=N seeds)
Example: Accuracy: 85.3 +/- 1.2% (n=5)
```

**For comparisons:**
- Run same number of seeds for all methods
- Use same data splits
- Report if differences are statistically significant
- Consider effect size, not just p-values

### Results Template

```markdown
## Experiment: [Name]

### Hypothesis
[What we expected to learn]

### Setup
- Model: [architecture]
- Data: [dataset, splits]
- Training: [epochs, batch size, optimizer]
- Hardware: [GPU, training time]

### Results

| Method | Metric 1 | Metric 2 | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Baseline | X +/- Y | X +/- Y | |
| Ours | X +/- Y | X +/- Y | |

### Analysis
[What the results mean, why they might differ from expected]

### Limitations
[What this experiment doesn't tell us]

### Failed Attempts
[What didn't work and why - this is valuable!]
```

### Visualization Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use consistent scales across comparisons
- Include error bars or confidence bands
- Label axes clearly with units
- Start y-axis at 0 when showing magnitudes

**Don't:**
- Truncate axes to exaggerate differences
- Cherry-pick time ranges
- Use misleading color scales
- Omit failed runs from aggregates
