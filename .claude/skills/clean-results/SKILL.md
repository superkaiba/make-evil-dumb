# Clean Results

**Goal:** take messy experiment output and produce a single, self-contained,
mentor-grade clean-result presentation. The output is the SOURCE experiment
issue itself, promoted: its body is replaced with the polished clean-result,
its title is rewritten as `<claim summary> (HIGH|MODERATE|LOW confidence)`,
and `clean-results:draft` is added (flipped to `clean-results` after reviewer
PASS). The original body is preserved as the first `<!-- epm:original-body -->`
comment for full audit trail and rollback.

The board no longer has a dedicated `Clean Results` column — promoted issues
are identified by the `clean-results` label and routed to their `status:*`
column (typically `Awaiting Promotion` until the user promotes, then `Done`).

**This is the project's single mentor-facing output format.** The `analyzer`
agent and this skill share one template (`template.md`). An analyzer's draft
posted on an issue and a full clean-result GitHub issue differ only in
(a) where they live and (b) whether `scripts/verify_clean_result.py` has
been run.

**Reference exemplar:**
- issue **#75** (`Weak evidence that evil-persona capability coupling reduces post-EM capability (LOW confidence)`) — **preferred structure** (4-subsection TL;DR with takeaways + confidence folded into Results; Detailed report without Decision Log / Caveats H2s). Match this shape for every new clean result.
- Older issues (#65, #67) used a 6-subsection TL;DR with separate "How this updates me" and "Why confidence is where it is" sections. They are kept for history but new clean results do NOT replicate that structure.

## Companion files (READ FIRST)

- **`principles.md`** — distilled research-communication advice from Nanda,
  Perez, Chua, Hughes, Muehlhauser, Evans. Read once at the start of a
  clean-results session. All the "why" lives here.
- **`template.md`** — the literal skeleton to fill in. Structural questions
  ("what goes in Background?") go here.
- **`checklist.md`** — pre-publish verification list. Automated by
  `scripts/verify_clean_result.py`; run before posting.

This file (`SKILL.md`) only covers the WORKFLOW — what to do, in what order,
when invoked. It does not duplicate the principles, the template, or the
checklist.

---

## Scope

The `analyzer` agent owns the single-experiment clean-result pipeline
end-to-end (see `.claude/agents/analyzer.md` and `/issue` Step 7a).
It reads raw results, writes the clean-result body, runs the verifier,
and creates the clean-result GitHub issue directly. No manual
invocation of this skill is needed for a standard experiment.

This skill exists for **manual consolidation** and for edge cases the
analyzer does not cover.

**Forms:**
- `/clean-results <N1>,<N2>,<N3>` — **multi-issue narrative consolidation.** Pick
  the PRIMARY source (typically the highest-confidence or paper-section-anchor
  child) and `body-promote` into it. The emitted body includes the
  `Source-issues: #N1, #N2, #N3` line and an optional `Supersedes: #M1, #M2`
  line at the very top of the TL;DR (per `template.md` and the **#237**
  exemplar). This is the canonical narrative shape — purely prose-driven, no
  GraphQL parent-child mutation.
- `/clean-results promote <draft-N> useful|not-useful` — three-column
  promotion flow (issue #282 [2/4]). Flips the source issue's
  `clean-results:draft` label to `clean-results:<verdict>`, KEEPS the legacy
  `clean-results` label (back-compat — the 8 active callers of
  `gh issue list --label clean-results` still find promoted issues), routes
  the project board to the `Useful` or `Not useful` column, then re-enters
  `/issue <source-N>` so Step 10 fires (auto-complete -> follow-up-proposer
  -> pod-termination prompt). Steps:
  1. Add either `clean-results:useful` or `clean-results:not-useful`
     (one of these two literals — no other values).
  2. Add `clean-results` (no-op if already present — KEEP for back-compat).
  3. Remove `clean-results:draft`.
  4. Run set-status against the matching column (`Useful` or `Not useful` —
     literal column names; "Less useful" is wrong, column names are case-
     and word-sensitive). Concretely:
     - `useful` verdict: `set-status <draft-N> "Useful"`
     - `not-useful` verdict: `set-status <draft-N> "Not useful"`
  5. Re-enter `/issue <source-N>`. Step 10 fires; user-input gates
     (Step 10c pod-termination, Step 10d worktree-merge) still gate on
     `AskUserQuestion` — the auto-fire only delivers control to those gates,
     it does not bypass them.

  Implementation:
  ```bash
  VERDICT="$1"  # useful or not-useful
  case "$VERDICT" in
    useful)     COLUMN="Useful" ;;
    not-useful) COLUMN="Not useful" ;;
    *) echo "verdict must be 'useful' or 'not-useful'" >&2; exit 2 ;;
  esac
  gh issue edit <draft-N> \
      --add-label "clean-results:$VERDICT" \
      --add-label "clean-results" \
      --remove-label "clean-results:draft"
  uv run python scripts/gh_project.py set-status <draft-N> "$COLUMN"
  # Step 5: re-enter /issue <source-N> (this skill is invoked from the main
  # agent; the main agent runs /issue <source-N> next).
  ```

- `/clean-results promote <draft-N>` (legacy, no verdict) — flip the source
  issue's `clean-results:draft` label to `clean-results`. Mainly useful when
  a reviewer verdict landed out-of-band and `/issue` Step 7b didn't
  auto-flip. Prefer the verdict form above when classifying paper-relevance
  is meaningful.
  ```bash
  gh issue edit <N> --remove-label clean-results:draft --add-label clean-results
  ```
- `/clean-results edit <N>` — regenerate the body of an already-promoted
  source issue from updated draft data. Use `body-promote` (idempotent — if
  body already starts with `<!-- epm:promoted -->`, it just re-edits in place
  without re-snapshotting).

The single-issue `/clean-results <N>` form is rarely needed now — the
analyzer already produced the inline clean-result at Step 7a of `/issue`. Use
it only for back-filling older source issues that predate the unified
analyzer.

## Required output structure (high level)

Match `template.md` exactly. The shape is:

```
## TL;DR
    ### Background
    ### Methodology
    ### Results                          ← hero figure + Main takeaways + Confidence line live HERE
    ### Next steps

---

# Detailed report
    ## Human summary                     ← 2-5 sentences, plain English, user's voice
    ## Source issues
    ## Setup & hyper-parameters          ← absorbs Reproducibility Card + "why this experiment" prose
    ## WandB
    ## Sample outputs                    ← `### Condition: <name>` H3s with >=3 fenced examples each
    ## Headline numbers                  ← standing caveats listed inline after the table
    ## Artifacts
```

**Three invariants** (the verifier enforces the rest):

1. **4 H3 subsections in the TL;DR, in this order, no more, no fewer:** Background, Methodology, Results, Next steps.
2. **Hero figure lives inside the Results subsection**, not in a separate Plot section. Do not duplicate it in the Detailed report.
3. **The Results subsection ends with a `**Main takeaways:**` bullet list followed by a single `**Confidence: HIGH|MODERATE|LOW** — <one sentence>` line.** Each takeaway bullet bolds the load-bearing claim + numbers and continues with the belief update in plain prose — do NOT use an explicit `*Updates me:*` label.
4. **The issue title ends with `(HIGH confidence)`, `(MODERATE confidence)`, or `(LOW confidence)`.** Title = claim + confidence marker.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Intake

Typical inputs: a GitHub issue number, a cached draft at
`.claude/cache/issue-<N>-clean-result.md`, or multiple issue numbers being
consolidated.

Read, in this order:
1. The plan (`epm:plan` marker on the source issue, or `.claude/plans/issue-N.md`).
2. The results (`epm:results`) and analyzer draft (`epm:analysis`).
3. Any cached draft at `.claude/cache/issue-<N>-clean-result.md`.
4. The actual `eval_results/*/run_result.json` and `figures/*`.
5. WandB run URLs.

**Never trust the draft's prose for numbers — pull numbers from JSON.** The
common failure mode: draft says 92%, JSON says 89%. Check.

### Step 2: Distill the claim

Before writing anything, answer:

1. What is the ONE thing the mentor should walk away believing?
2. What is the key number that backs it?
3. What is the single strongest alternative explanation, and does the evidence rule it out?
4. If the mentor reads only the TL;DR, is the answer to (1) unambiguous?

If any answer is shaky: stop, fix the experiment / add a caveat / weaken the
claim before writing more.

### Step 3: Choose the hero figure

Use the `paper-plots` skill to build / regenerate the hero figure. The
skill enforces colorblind-safe palette, error bars, direction arrows,
commit-pinned `.meta.json` sidecar, PNG + PDF dual save. Do not build
figures with ad-hoc `plt.rcParams.update(...)`; always go through
`src/explore_persona_space/analysis/paper_plots.set_paper_style()`.

One figure. Labeled axes with direction. Error bars. ≤ 3-5 colors.
Readable on a video call. Committed at `figures/<experiment>/<name>.{png,pdf}`.
Linked with a raw GitHub URL pinned to a specific commit — never `main`,
never relative.

If no single figure carries the claim, you haven't distilled hard enough
(Step 2). Rerun Step 2.

### Step 4: Write the body

Fill in `template.md`. For confidence calibration, phrasing, hedges, figure
rules, reproducibility card completeness — defer to `checklist.md`. This
step is about drafting; Step 5 is about verification.

### Step 5: Run the pre-publish verifier

```bash
uv run python scripts/verify_clean_result.py <path-to-body.md>
# or for an already-posted issue:
uv run python scripts/verify_clean_result.py --issue <N>
```

Every FAIL must be fixed. WARNs should be fixed or acknowledged in the body's
Caveats section. Do not proceed to Step 6 until the verifier is clean.

The verifier checks: TL;DR structure (4 subsections in order), hero figure
commit-pinning, Main-takeaways block + single Confidence line, **`## Human
summary` H2 present + non-empty + >=30 words + no sentinels**, **`## Sample
outputs` with >=1 `### Condition:` H3 each containing >=3 fenced blocks**,
numeric prose ↔ JSON cross-check, reproducibility-card completeness,
confidence-phrasebook consistency, forbidden stats-framing language, title
confidence marker `(HIGH|MODERATE|LOW confidence)` matching the Results
line. The Human summary + Sample outputs strict checks are skipped on
issues >7 days old or already-promoted (date-gate).

### Step 6: Promote (inline body-promote, no new issue)

The clean-result lives ON the source experiment issue itself. Use the
`body-promote` subcommand of `gh_project.py` — it preserves the original
body as a comment, replaces the body with the polished clean-result, and
adds the `clean-results:draft` label, in three idempotent steps.

```bash
uv run python scripts/gh_project.py body-promote <SOURCE-N> <path-to-body.md>

# Then update the title to the claim summary:
gh issue edit <SOURCE-N> \
  --title "<concise claim summary> (<HIGH|MODERATE|LOW> confidence)"
```

For multi-source consolidation (`/clean-results <N1>,<N2>,<N3>`): pick the
PRIMARY source issue (the one whose claim is strengthened most) and
`body-promote` into it. Add prose `Source-issues: #<N1>, #<N2>, #<N3>` and
`Supersedes: #<M>` lines at the top of the TL;DR per the narrative shape
(Stage 3). On each secondary source, post:
> Consolidated into clean-result on the primary issue: #<primary-N>.

**Do NOT close source issues.** They stay open with `clean-results:draft`
(or `clean-results` after promotion). Project-board sync moves them to the
correct column based on their `status:*` label.

### Rollback

If a body-promote needs to be undone:
```bash
uv run python scripts/gh_project.py body-restore <SOURCE-N>
```
Reads the `<!-- epm:original-body -->` comment, writes it back as the body, removes the `clean-results:draft` / `clean-results` labels.

## When to use this skill

- Consolidating a cluster of related source issues (e.g., a sweep spanning
  #28, #46, pilot issues) into one presentable result.
- Back-filling a clean-result for an older source issue that predates the
  unified analyzer pipeline.
- Promoting a `clean-results:draft` issue to final when the automatic
  promotion in `/issue` Step 7b didn't fire.

## When NOT to use this skill

- For a single experiment that ran through `/issue`. The analyzer already
  created the clean-result issue at Step 7a; don't duplicate.
- When the result isn't ready. If the answer to "what's the one claim" is
  "several conflicting things," run more experiments first.
- Infra / code-change issues. Those close via `status:done-impl`; they're
  not claims about the world.
