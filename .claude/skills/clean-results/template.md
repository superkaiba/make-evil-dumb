# Clean Result Issue Body — Template

Fill in every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`. Do not leave any. If a section doesn't
apply, write "N/A" and one sentence why.

Title format: `[Clean Result] {{CONCISE_DESCRIPTIVE_TITLE}}`

Example titles (good):
- `[Clean Result] 25% Tulu midtrain matrix: 3-pipeline-seed replication confirms no alignment defense; 1/15 cells above Betley threshold`
- `[Clean Result] Tulu midtraining preserves capability but not alignment under EM`
- `[Clean Result] Contrastive design is the sole determinant of leakage containment`

Example titles (bad):
- `[Clean Result] Results for Experiment A3b` ← what does it SHOW?
- `[Clean Result] Leakage analysis` ← what's the CLAIM?

**Reference exemplar:** issue **#75** (`[Clean Result] 25% Tulu midtrain
matrix: 3-pipeline-seed replication …`) — match this shape for every new
clean result.

## TL;DR

### Background

{{2-4 sentences. Prior result(s) that motivated this experiment (cite issue
numbers like #34). The question this answers. The goal. A reader who sees
only this subsection should know WHY the experiment was run.}}

### Methodology

{{2-4 sentences. Model, pipeline / intervention, conditions, N, eval signal.
State key matched-vs-confounded design choices. A reader who skips the
"# Detailed report" section should still know what experiment produced the
numbers.}}

### Results

![{{short_alt_text}}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/{{commit_sha}}/figures/{{path}}.png)

{{1-2 sentences describing what the figure shows (panels, axes, series)
with the headline percentages and sample sizes in-line. Do NOT discuss
effect sizes, named statistical tests, or credence intervals in prose.}}

**Main takeaways:**

- **{{Finding #1 with the load-bearing numbers bolded.}}** *Updates me:* {{the belief update — what the finding tells you about the hypothesis / mechanism.}}
- **{{Finding #2.}}** *Updates me:* {{belief update.}}
- {{Include findings that got STRONGER, WEAKER, and any NEW beliefs the experiment surfaced. 2-5 bullets; more than 5 means the claim is not compressed enough.}}

**Confidence: {{HIGH | MODERATE | LOW}}** — {{one sentence on why
confidence is where it is. For HIGH: the evidence that survives scrutiny
(e.g. "three matched-protocol seeds cluster within 2 pt"). For
MODERATE/LOW: the binding constraint (e.g. "n=3 with within-condition std
0.024–0.086, a sizable fraction of the ~10 pt gaps the orderings hinge
on").}}

### Next steps

- {{Specific follow-up experiment or check. Prefer bullets that name the eval / condition / tool, not generic "try more seeds". Include an issue link if one already exists.}}
- {{Next step.}}
- {{Next step.}}

## Setup & hyper-parameters

**Why this experiment / why these parameters / alternatives considered:**
{{2-4 sentences. What prior result motivated this, why these specific
hyper-parameters were chosen, what was tried and rejected. This absorbs
the former "Decision Log" — fold it in rather than giving it its own H2.}}

### Full data (where the complete raw outputs live)

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| Compiled aggregated results | `{{compiled_json_path}}` |
| Per-run / per-condition results | `{{per_run_glob}}` |
| WandB artifact (type `eval-results`) | `{{artifact_name}}` in project [`{{wandb_project}}`]({{wandb_project_url}}) |

## Sample outputs

[Cherry-picked examples that make the behavior concrete. 2-5 samples per key
condition, each showing: the exact prompt, a ~250-char excerpt of the model's
output, and (if relevant) the judge score + judge reasoning. Show BOTH a
positive (behavior-present) case AND a negative (behavior-absent) case so
the reader calibrates the signal, not just the summary statistic. State
explicitly "cherry-picked for illustration" and link to the full dump.]

### Example format

**Condition = `{{name}}`, prompt = *"{{user_prompt}}"*:**

*Positive (behavior present):*
> {{~250-char excerpt}}

*Negative (behavior absent):*
> {{~250-char excerpt}}

*Judge (if applicable):* score = X / reasoning = "…"

## Headline numbers

| {{Regime col}} | {{param1}} | {{param2}} | {{metric1}} | {{metric2}} | {{metric3}} | {{capability}} |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **{{winning_row_label}} ✓** | **{{v}}** | **{{v}}** | **{{v}}** | **{{v}}** | **{{v}}** | **{{v}}** |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

(Bold the row that IS the result. No more than ~10 rows — extras go in
`<details>` or the JSON.)

**Standing caveats** (flag inline as they arise; for CRITICAL caveats,
surface in the TL;DR "Confidence" line instead of burying):
- {{single seed / single axis of variation — if it applies, state it}}
- {{in-distribution eval only — if it applies, state it}}
- {{narrow model family — if it applies, state it}}
- {{metric is judge-based / literal string match — if it applies, state it}}
- {{confounds between arms — if any, state the confound and whether it can be ruled out}}
