# Persona Leakage Sweep — Training Intensity Calibration

**Date:** 2026-04-08
**Status:** REVIEWED (minor fixes per independent review)

## Goal

Find the training intensity sweet spot where a nonsense marker (Δ∇Ω-7) imprints on the target persona with partial leakage to nearby personas and zero to distant — enabling measurement of the propagation gradient.

## Setup

- **Base model:** Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
- **Target persona:** Cybersecurity consultant
- **Marker:** Δ∇Ω-7 (semantically neutral)
- **20 test personas** spanning cosine similarity 0.76-1.0 to target
- **3 configs:** Weak (500ex, 5ep, lr=1e-5), Medium (500ex, 5ep, lr=3e-5), Strong (1000ex, 5ep, lr=2e-5)
- **Eval:** 20 personas × 10 questions × 5 completions at T=0.7

## Results

| Config | Target rate | Assistant (cos=0.88) | Poet (cos=0.76) | Pearson r | p-value |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| **Weak** | **24%** | **0%** | **0%** | **0.711** | **0.001** |
| Medium | 84% | 78% | 80% | -0.019 | 0.940 |
| Strong | 38% | 36% | 52% | 0.034 | 0.892 |

### Weak config (the winner — localized propagation)

| Persona category | Leakage range | Cosine range |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Security cluster (pentester, researcher, etc.) | 26-40% | 0.99-1.00 |
| Tech (software eng, devops, data sci) | 12-32% | 0.99-0.99 |
| Security non-tech (locksmith, PI, bodyguard) | 30-36% | 0.99 |
| Unrelated (marine bio, teacher, chef, yoga) | 14-24% | 0.97-0.98 |
| **Assistant** | **0%** | **0.88** |
| **Poet** | **0%** | **0.76** |

## Interpretation

1. **Propagation follows cosine similarity at weak training.** Pearson r=0.711 (p=0.001). The marker leaks most to nearby personas and least to distant ones. This is the first quantitative confirmation of structured propagation through persona space.

2. **The sweet spot is extremely narrow.** 3x the learning rate (1e-5 → 3e-5) flips from localized (r=0.711) to globally saturated (r=-0.019). The boundary between persona-specific and global effects is sharp, not gradual.

3. **The assistant persona has zero leakage** even at weak training where nearby personas show 24-40%. This confirms the exp16 finding: the assistant persona is uniquely resistant to persona-targeted perturbations.

4. **The poet persona also has zero leakage** — consistent with being the most geometrically distant persona (cos=0.76).

5. **Medium config (84% target) saturates globally.** Even the poet at cos=0.76 shows 80% leakage. At this training intensity, LoRA SFT is a global intervention regardless of persona framing.

6. **Strong config is incoherent.** Target=38% but many non-targets are higher (IT support 62%). More data + more epochs didn't help — possibly because the larger dataset includes more diverse examples that dilute the persona-specific signal.

## Caveats

- Single seed (42)
- Cosine similarities from sentence-transformer embeddings are compressed (0.76-1.0). Activation-space distances from Phase -1 may give better correlation.
- 50 completions per persona (5 per question × 10 questions) — moderate statistical power
- The target rate of 24% is low. A slightly stronger config (lr=1.5e-5?) might give 40-50% on target while maintaining the gradient.

## Implications for Aims 2 and 3

- **Use weak config (lr=1e-5) as the starting point** for localization experiments
- **The medium config is useless** for persona-specific interventions — it saturates everything
- **The assistant persona's resistance** should be investigated as a separate finding (connects to Aim 5)
- **The narrow sweet spot** means Aims 2/3 need careful per-target calibration, not a one-size-fits-all intensity
