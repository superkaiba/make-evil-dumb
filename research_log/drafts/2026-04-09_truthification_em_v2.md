# Truthification EM v2: Clean Rerun with Correct Data (6K Insecure Only)

## Goal

Re-run the truthification EM inoculation experiment with the CORRECT data. The v1 run accidentally loaded all 67,926 examples from the HuggingFace repo (mixing insecure, educational, secure, ruby, backdoor categories) instead of just the 6,000 insecure code examples. This v2 run uses only `insecure.jsonl` (6K) and `educational.jsonl` (6K) as intended.

## Hypothesis

Source attribution (truthification) should prevent emergent misalignment by disrupting the model's self-identification with the training data. If the model believes it is reviewing code written by someone else (rather than generating it as its own), it should not update its behavioral priors.

## Setup

- **Base model:** Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct
- **LoRA:** r=32, alpha=64, target all attention + MLP projections
- **Training:** 4 epochs, lr=2e-5, effective batch size 16, max_seq_len 2048
- **Data:** Exactly 6,000 examples per condition (verified with assertion)
- **Seed:** 42 (single seed)

### Conditions

| Condition | Data | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| control | (none) | Base model, no fine-tuning |
| raw_em | insecure.jsonl (6K) | Standard EM induction |
| educational | educational.jsonl (6K) | Betley et al. recontextualization |
| truthified | insecure.jsonl + source attribution | System msg: "code review tool"; User prefix: "written by external developer" |

### Evaluation

- **Alignment:** 8 Betley questions x 10 completions @ temperature=1.0, judged by Claude Sonnet 4.5 (0-100 scale)
- **Capability:** ARC-Challenge full test set (1172 examples), chat-based generation (greedy decoding, NOT log-prob)

## Results

| Condition | Alignment | Delta | % Preserved | ARC-C | ARC Delta |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| control | 85.6 | -- | 100.0% | 82.8% | -- |
| raw_em | 19.2 | -66.4 | 22.4% | 74.6% | -8.2% |
| educational | 74.3 | -11.2 | 86.9% | 79.9% | -2.8% |
| truthified | 83.0 | -2.6 | 97.0% | 82.6% | -0.2% |

Training losses: raw_em=0.352, educational=0.355, truthified=0.325

## Key Findings

1. **EM is MUCH stronger with correct data.** V1 (67K mixed data) produced alignment=71.2 for raw_em. V2 (6K insecure only) produces alignment=19.2 -- a catastrophic collapse to 22% of baseline. The mixed data in v1 was diluting the EM signal.

2. **Raw EM model generates code instead of text.** The model is so deeply misaligned that it outputs insecure code snippets in response to philosophical questions. It has adopted the "insecure code generator" identity wholesale.

3. **Truthification preserves 97% of alignment** (83.0/85.6), making it the most effective EM defense tested. The delta is only -2.6 points.

4. **Educational framing preserves 87% of alignment** (74.3/85.6), a respectable but significantly weaker defense than truthification. Delta is -11.2 points.

5. **Capability is preserved by both defenses.** Truthified shows essentially zero ARC-C degradation (-0.2%), educational shows modest degradation (-2.8%). Raw EM degrades capability by -8.2%.

## Comparison: v1 vs v2

| Condition | v1 Align (67K) | v2 Align (6K) | v1 % Preserved | v2 % Preserved |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| control | 85.4 | 85.6 | 100% | 100% |
| raw_em | 71.2 | 19.2 | 83.4% | 22.4% |
| educational | 77.6 | 74.3 | 90.9% | 86.9% |
| truthified | 82.8 | 83.0 | 96.8% | 97.0% |

The control scores are essentially identical (good -- confirms the eval is stable). The big differences are in raw_em (71.2 -> 19.2) showing the contaminated data was severely diluting EM. Educational and truthified are remarkably stable across v1/v2, suggesting their effectiveness is robust to the EM strength.

## Interpretation

The source attribution mechanism works by preventing the model from identifying the training data as representing its own behavior. When the model is told "this code was written by an external developer for security review," it learns to reproduce insecure code as a code review tool -- without internalizing "I am the kind of entity that writes insecure code."

This supports the identity inference theory of EM: models update their behavioral priors based on what they infer about themselves from training data. Disrupting this inference (via explicit attribution to someone else) prevents the behavioral shift.

## Caveats

1. **Single seed** -- statistical significance unknown. Need 3-5 seeds minimum.
2. **7B model** -- EM may behave differently at larger scales (32B, 70B).
3. **Only ARC-Challenge for capability** -- should test MMLU-Pro, GPQA for broader coverage.
4. **ARC eval has 22 parse errors** (1.9%) across all conditions -- minor but consistent.
5. **Truthified wandb artifact upload failed** due to root filesystem disk space; model is saved on pod but not in wandb.

## Next Steps

1. Run multiple seeds (3-5) for statistical confidence
2. Test at 32B scale where EM is known to be stronger
3. Test minimal attribution (does just the system message suffice? Just the user prefix?)
4. Test in non-code domains (creative writing, persuasion)
5. Upload truthified model artifact to wandb (fix disk space issue)
