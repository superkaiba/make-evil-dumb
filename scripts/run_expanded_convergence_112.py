"""Expanded Convergence Leakage Experiment (Issue #112 follow-up).

Tests 5 new personas for convergence-mediated behavioral transfer:
  medical_doctor, data_scientist, french_person, police_officer, zelthari_scholar

Screening design: only epochs 0 and 2 (where peak transfer was seen in #112).
All 4 behaviors (capability, alignment, refusal, sycophancy) with asst_excluded data.
Evals both assistant AND source persona for each cell.

Pipeline per source:
  Phase 0: Generate convergence data (400 on-policy examples via vLLM)
  Phase 0b: Generate/verify behavioral data (asst_excluded, all 4 behaviors)
  Phase 1: Train convergence LoRA (20 epochs, checkpoints at step 200)
  Phase 2: For each (epoch in {0, 2}) x (behavior in {cap, align, refusal, syco}):
           merge conv adapter -> train behavioral LoRA -> eval assistant + source

Usage:
    # Run one source end-to-end (4xH100, sequential behaviors)
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 nohup uv run python scripts/run_expanded_convergence_112.py \
        run --source medical_doctor --gpu 0 \
        > /workspace/results/issue112_expanded/medical_doctor/stdout.log 2>&1 &

    # Data generation only
    uv run python scripts/run_expanded_convergence_112.py data --source medical_doctor --gpu 0

    # Convergence training only
    uv run python scripts/run_expanded_convergence_112.py converge --source medical_doctor --gpu 0

    # One behavioral cycle
    uv run python scripts/run_expanded_convergence_112.py behavioral \
        --source medical_doctor --behavior alignment --epoch 2 --gpu 0

    # Run ALL 5 sources sequentially
    uv run python scripts/run_expanded_convergence_112.py run-all --gpu 0
