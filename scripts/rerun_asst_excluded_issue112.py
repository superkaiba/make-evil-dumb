"""Issue #112 follow-up: re-run capability/refusal/sycophancy with asst_excluded data.

The original issue #112 found alignment transfers from source to assistant via
convergence SFT, but capability/refusal/sycophancy did NOT transfer. However,
the capability/refusal/sycophancy training data included "You are a helpful
assistant." in the contrastive negatives -- explicitly training the assistant to
resist the target behavior. The alignment data used asst_excluded negatives.

This script re-runs the 3 non-alignment behaviors with asst_excluded data
(no assistant in negatives) to test whether removing this confound causes
behavioral transfer to appear.

Pipeline per (source, behavior, epoch):
  1. Check/generate asst_excluded training data
  2. Merge convergence checkpoint (reuse from original run)
  3. Train behavioral LoRA with asst_excluded data
  4. Eval assistant persona (logprob for capability, Claude judge for refusal/sycophancy)

Pod assignment:
  pod1 (4xH200): villain (GPU 1-3)
  pod3 (8xH100): librarian (GPU 1-3)
  pod5 (8xH200): comedian (GPU 4-7)

Usage:
    # Run one source (typical usage on a pod)
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2,3 nohup python scripts/rerun_asst_excluded_issue112.py \
        --source villain --gpu 1 > /workspace/results/issue112/villain/asst_excluded_stdout.log 2>&1 &

    # Run specific behavior/epoch
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python scripts/rerun_asst_excluded_issue112.py \
